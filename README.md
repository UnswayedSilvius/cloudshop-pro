# CloudShop Pro – DevOps Deployment Platform

CloudShop Pro is a simple web application used to demonstrate real-world
DevOps practices such as containerization, CI/CD automation, Kubernetes
deployment, infrastructure provisioning, and monitoring.

The application itself is intentionally simple so the focus remains on
DevOps workflows rather than application complexity.

## Architecture
- React frontend served via Nginx
- Flask backend API
- Containerized using Docker
- Deployed on Kubernetes
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
- Infrastructure managed using Terraform
